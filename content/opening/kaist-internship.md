**Expectations**

We expect interns to participate in a predefined research agenda as a co-author, working closely with their PhD student host.

**Supervision**

Your day-to-day supervisor is the PhD student you apply to work with. They define the research direction, set milestones, and provide regular feedback. Joon is available for broader guidance but does not manage the internship on a daily basis. Choose your PhD student host carefully - your internship experience depends largely on this match.

**Application process**
